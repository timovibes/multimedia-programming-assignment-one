# Multimedia Programming Assignment One

This project is part of my Multimedia Programming course. It demonstrates how to create an interactive HTML page that displays images and uses JavaScript to enhance functionality when an image is clicked.

## üìñ Description

The webpage contains three images arranged in a gallery layout.  
When a user clicks on any image, a JavaScript function is triggered to display a message showing which image was clicked.  
The page also includes basic CSS styling for layout and hover effects.
